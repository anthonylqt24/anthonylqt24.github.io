 Final Porfolio Project for Web-Intro

This is a project for CS410-Web-Intro. The project is my porfolio website that I will use for jon application later.This project is my personal work with the technologies that I learned in this course including but not limited to: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5. The project is made of mostly barebone HTML and CSS. And the final section will not send any email to me at all. It is only for the show of basic JavaScript and Bootstrap skills.

You will need Visual Studio Code to recreate the website, with a live server feature built-in. And you will need a web browsers to run it. I recommend Google Chrome, since my JavaScript code will run best on it. Firefox, Safari and other browsers also work.

In making this website, I read documentations and follow tutorials from:
    The Bootstrap website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
    The W3School website: https://www.w3schools.com/
    The png images are from: https://www.kindpng.com/
    The background image: https://unsplash.com/photos/ahYX46whD8s

The site is deployed using the GitHub Pages feature.

Thank you for your interest in my website.
