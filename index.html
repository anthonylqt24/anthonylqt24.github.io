          Vietnam is the place I was born 29 years ago. Living in the United States for the last 5 years and
          moved to Portland Oregon in 2018, I spent most of my time studying Computer Science in Portland
          State University and will be graduating in June 2022. Improving my skills and growing further at
          your company is what I am looking forward to in the next couple years. Becoming a professional
          developer and creating applications that many people will love is the goal that I set for myself.
